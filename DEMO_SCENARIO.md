## ðŸŽ¬ Demo Script

### **Scene 1: The Problem (1-2 minutes)**

**Setup**: Alex is working on a React application and encounters a frustrating bug.

**Chat with Meno**:
```
Alex: "I'm getting this weird error in my React app: 'Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component'. I've been trying to fix it for hours but it keeps happening."

Meno: "This is a common React issue! The error occurs when you try to update state after a component has been unmounted. This usually happens with async operations like API calls or timers.

Can you show me where you're making API calls or using useEffect in your component? Also, are you using any cleanup functions?"
```

**Continue the conversation**:
```
Alex: "I have a useEffect that fetches data from an API, and I'm setting state with the response. But sometimes the user navigates away before the API call completes."

Meno: "Ah, that's exactly the issue! When the user navigates away, your component unmounts, but the API call is still pending. When it finally completes, it tries to update state on an unmounted component.

Here's the solution: you need to add a cleanup function to your useEffect that cancels the API call or prevents the state update. You can use an AbortController or a simple flag.

Would you like me to show you how to implement this?"
```

**Demonstrate the solution**:
```
Alex: "Yes, please show me how to fix this!"

Meno: "Here's how to fix it using a cleanup flag:

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    let isMounted = true; // Cleanup flag
    
    const fetchData = async () => {
      setLoading(true);
      try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/data');
        const result = await response.json();
        
        // Only update state if component is still mounted
        if (isMounted) {
          setData(result);
          setLoading(false);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        if (isMounted) {
          console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
          setLoading(false);
        }
      }
    };

    fetchData();

    // Cleanup function
    return () => {
      isMounted = false;
    };
  }, []);

  // ... rest of component
}
```

The key is checking `isMounted` before updating state. This prevents the warning and potential memory leaks."
```

### **Scene 2: Learning Capture Trigger (30 seconds)**

**Action**: Click the floating "ðŸ’¡ Capture Learning" button

**Narration**: "Now that Alex has solved this problem, they want to capture this learning for their team. They click the capture button to start the process."

### **Scene 3: Audience Selection (30 seconds)**

**Modal appears**:
```
"I'll help track this problem and solution. Who might face this same problem?"

ðŸ‘¥ My Team
ðŸ”® Future me  
ðŸ†• New hires

[Select: ðŸ‘¥ My Team]
```

**Narration**: "Alex selects 'My Team' because this is a common React issue that other developers on the team will likely encounter."

### **Scene 4: Quick Capture Form (1 minute)**

**Fill out the form**:
```
What was the problem?
React state update on unmounted component warning

What was its cause?
API calls completing after user navigates away from page

What was the solution?
Added cleanup flag in useEffect to prevent state updates on unmounted components

[Generate Card]
```

**Narration**: "Alex quickly captures the key details. Notice how simple this is - just three questions that take about 30 seconds to answer."

### **Scene 5: AI-Enhanced Learning (2-3 minutes)**

**AI Analysis appears**:
```
ðŸ¤– AI Analysis
âœ… Your summary captures the key points well. You've identified the root cause (async operations after unmount) and the solution (cleanup flags).

ðŸ¤” What would your teammate ask?
"Wait, what about AbortController? Should we use that instead of a cleanup flag? And does this pattern work for all async operations like timers and subscriptions?"

[How would you respond to this question? (optional)...]
```

**Alex's response**:
```
"Great question! AbortController is actually better for API calls because it can cancel the actual network request. But cleanup flags work for everything - timers, subscriptions, any async operation. I use AbortController for fetch calls and cleanup flags for everything else. Both patterns solve the same problem but in different ways."
```

**Continue with confidence assessment**:
```
ðŸ’­ How confident are you in your understanding?
ðŸ˜Š Very confident

ðŸ’¡ Key Learning
React components need cleanup for async operations to prevent state updates on unmounted components. Use AbortController for API calls and cleanup flags for other async operations.

Does this capture the main takeaway?
âœ“ Yes, exactly
```

**Narration**: "Notice how the AI generated a realistic question that a teammate would actually ask in a code review. This creates a more engaging, social learning experience."

### **Scene 6: Enhanced Insight Card (1 minute)**

**Final card appears**:
```
ðŸ’¡ Learning Insight - For: ðŸ‘¥ Team

**Problem:** React state update on unmounted component warning
**Cause:** API calls completing after user navigates away from page
**Solution:** Added cleanup flag in useEffect to prevent state updates on unmounted components

**Key Learning:** React components need cleanup for async operations to prevent state updates on unmounted components. Use AbortController for API calls and cleanup flags for other async operations.

**Reflection:** "Wait, what about AbortController? Should we use that instead of a cleanup flag? And does this pattern work for all async operations like timers and subscriptions?"
"Great question! AbortController is actually better for API calls because it can cancel the actual network request. But cleanup flags work for everything - timers, subscriptions, any async operation.
